							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I'm a UX Designer with background in teaching and in education management. As a language teacher, I'm focused on creating engaging learning experiences for students from widely diverse backgrounds, continuously adapting my lessons to meet changing needs and expectations. In UX Design, I look forward to using the empathy, creativity, and agility that  enable me to achieve my goals in teaching in order  to create intuitive designs that make technology accessible to everyone, and a pleasure to use.<br /><br />Prior to switching over exclusively to teaching, I was the Director of Studies for a language academy that focused on corporate language training. During my time in management, I helped a small business grow from 10 to 65 teachers in about 5 years and was a key contributor to the reputation of our school as one of the best academies to work for in the city. I cultivated successful collaborations that resulted in lasting client relationships and dramatically improved employee retention rates. The experience I gained in balancing customer needs, employee satisfaction, and business objectives, will help me, as a UX Designer, not only in developing productive collaborations with different stakeholders, but also in creating products that meet both business goals and user needs.<br /><br />Please feel free to download my resume for more details about my background.<br />
